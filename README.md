# Solution Evaluation Tool

This project allows you to evaluate multiple problem-solution pairs using OpenAI's ChatGPT.

## Setup

1. Install the required packages:

pip install openai


2. Ensure you've set up your OpenAI API key in the main script:

openai.api_key = 'YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY'

Usage
Prepare your problem-solution pairs. There are 100 sample problems in the problems directory.
Run the main evaluation script:

python your_evaluation_script_name.py

Follow the on-screen instructions to input your solutions for the problems and to set your evaluation criteria.

Receive an overall assessment based on the criteria you've provided.

Note
The quality of the assessment heavily depends on the clarity of your criteria and the format of your problems and solutions. Adjust the script as needed to fit your specific use case.
